# BCG Data Science & Analytics

## Welcome to the Data Science & Analytics
We recognise that these tasks are challenging and that there are undoubtedly phrases and terminology
you may not have heard before – don’t worry! We have tried to make this experience as true to life as
possible and therefore our ask is that you attempt to seek out independent sources of information and do
your own research, as required, to help guide you through the tasks.
Welcome to the BCG GAMMA virtual experience! BCG GAMMA is transforming the businesses of today
through data science and advanced analytics initiatives and our goal is to help companies generate
competitive advantage through these initiatives. This module is designed to give you a feel of what it is
like to work at BCG GAMMA as we help our clients using data science.
Our client for this project is PowerCo, a major utilities company. PowerCo has had declining profits due to
significant customer churn. We have been engaged to drive churn reduction within their Small & Medium
Enterprise (SME) customers.
As a BCG GAMMA Data Scientist, you can expect to work in many different industries, and on many
different types of business challenges. The skills you will use and develop today are part of the consultant
and data scientist toolkits, and will be applicable to many different types of cases.
We hope you will enjoy your virtual experience and get a glimpse into the exciting life of a Data Scientist
at BCG GAMMA!
This project contain four takes:
## 1: Business Understanding & Hypothesis Framing
Understanding the business context and problem statement.
### Here is the background information on your task
PowerCo is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to corporate, SME (Small &
Medium Enterprise), and residential customers. The power-liberalization of the energy
market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment.
They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.
A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, it is helpful to know
which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current price, for which a good
predictive model could be useful.
Moreover, for those cstomers that are at risk of churning, a discount might incentivize them
to stay with our client. The head of the SME division is considering a 20% discount that is
considered large enough to dissuade almost anyone from churning (especially those for
whom price is the primary concern).
The Associate Director (AD) held an initial team meeting to discuss various hypotheses,
including churn due to price sensitivity. After discussion with your team, you have been
asked to go deeper on the hypothesis that the churn is driven by the customers’ price
sensitivities.
Your AD wants an email with your thoughts on how the team should go about testing this
hypothesis.
The client plans to use the predictive model on the 1st working day of every month to
indicate to which customers the 20% discount should be offered.

### Here is your task
Your first task today is to understand what is going on with the client and to think about how
you would approach this problem and test the specific hypothesis.
You must formulate the hypothesis as a data science problem and lay out the major steps
needed to test this hypothesis. Communicate your thoughts and findings in an email to your
AD, focusing on the data that you would need from the client and the analytical models you
would use to test such a hypothesis.
We would suggest spending no more than one hour on this task.
Please note, there are multiple ways to approach the task and that the model answer is just
one way to do it.
If you are stuck:
1. Remember what the key factors are for a customer deciding to stay with or switch
providers
2. Think of data sources and fields that could be used to explore the contribution of
various factors to a customer’s possible action
3. Ideally, what would a data frame of your choice look like – what should each column
and row represent?
4. What kind of exploratory analyses on the relevant fields can give more insights about
the customer's churn behavior?
